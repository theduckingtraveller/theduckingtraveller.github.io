          Hey there!
          <br>
          Let me tell you a little something about me: Iâ€™m an Engineer by profession but was bitten by the travel bug a long long time ago. I always talked about writing about my adventures and this is as good a time as ever to start! I also wanted to share my love for traveling with all the other wanderers out there and maybe help you guys plan your next big adventure.

          The world is shrinking and it is possible to go all over and speak to different people and be a part of something that you never thought you could be. I have been able to be a part of a few of these adventures and am here to share my thoughts with all of you out there.

          Hope you enjoy reading the blogs and my travel escapades.
          <br>
          <br>
          Thanks for tuning in!
