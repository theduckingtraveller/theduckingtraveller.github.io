## Sunsets in Mauii

I think this goes without saying but I would consider missing a sunset in Hawaii to be a cardinal sin. Each sunset here is so unique and beautiful.

My favourite was the sunset from Mt. Haleakala.

The sunset from any beach is breathtaking. We were swimming in the pool as the sun set and it was peaceful all around.

The waves get a little rough sometimes during sunset and the water also begins to cool down but dipping your feet into the pacific with a cold Mai Tai is an experience I cannot forget.


## Food in Maui

I was surprised at the ease of getting vegetarian food in Maui. I loved all the local delicacies, the fruits and the amazing shaved ice! Here are some of my top recommendations.

When in Hawaii, you have got to stop at one of the local food carts along the street for some very fresh coconut water.

We stopped along Kahekili Highway on our way to Waihee Ridge Trail to get some delicious shaved ice from Lorraine Shave Ice stand. Lorraine is the sweetest lady and will make you a custom shaved ice that will melt you away.

Stop by Down to Earth Organic & Natural at Kahului for a selection of local fruits if you don't spot any fruit stands along your drive.

I have been a huge fan of Maui Brewing Co. way before I even went to Maui and so a stop at their brewery was a must do for me. They have a variety of local beer on tap that I loved. It is also a really nice place to get dinner - they have both indoor seating and an outdoor area with string lights and live music.

When in Kihei, you have to go to Kihei Caffe. You should expect long lines but the food is totally worth it. There is a really cute coffee shop called Lava Java Coffee Roasters where you can get your morning cuppa as you wait to get brunch. There are also really nice local markets to purchase souvenirs to take back with you.

I also suggest trying out Kitoko Maui for Japanese food and Farmacy Health Bar for some nice Acai bowls.

Nalu's South Shore Grill is another one of my favourites that offers a huge variety of food and some delicious mai tai's.

One of the locals suggested we go to Wow Wow Hawaiian Lemonade to get Acai Bowls. It was delicious, filling and refreshing at the same time.

When in Maui - you should also try local macadamia nut banana bread. You will find several stands selling them and if you have a sweet tooth, or even if you don't, they are some of the most tasty treats I have eaten.

#### Other restaurants to try:

- Earth Aloha Eats (Vegan)
- Moku Roots (Vegan)
- Fleetwood's on Front St (Good bar vibe)
- Bistro Molokini (Fancy Dinner)
- Joey's Kitchen (Quick bite)


## Where to stay?

There are several great places to stay in Maui depending on what you prefer to do more. I would recommend staying on the west coast for the majority of your stay because there are more things to do around there. I wish we had stayed for a day in Wailua so we could do the entire Road to Hana.

We stayed at the Aston Kaanapali Shores for our first few days. The hotel is very centrally located, has a great view of the ocean and has the nicest staff members.

For the rest of our trip, we stayed at The Grand Wailea Resort in Wailea. This is a little further away from the rest of the more touristy spots but the hotel was as the name suggested - Grand!


Hawaii is the kind of place you want to keep coming back to. The people, the beaches, the sunset, the food - it all takes your breath away. I was here for a short while but I cannot wait to be back on my next Hawaiian adventure!
