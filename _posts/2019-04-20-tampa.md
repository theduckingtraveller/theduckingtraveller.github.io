Ever since I was introduced to travel, I have wanted to go on an adventure all by myself. Until now, I would make excuses and always end up traveling with other people. I decided on traveling solo only because I exhausted all reason on why it is not a good idea.

 Once you're in your late 20's you you realize that you are the best company you can have and that is when I decided that I need get out of my comfort and experience traveling solo. Tampa, Florida felt like the best place to have a relaxing fun weekend getaway by myself.

Although Tampa Bay is very bike and pedestrian friendly, it is a good idea to rent a vehicle so you don't end up spending a lot of time on public transportation. You can rent cars directly from the airport for the duration of your stay.

## When to go

 Tampa is beautiful year long but you might have to book flight tickets in advance so that you get a good deal.

 The less popular time to visit Tampa Bay is during the months of September to December when the weather is slightly cooler and the tourist season is just wearing off. Although May to August are considered the busiest(also wettest) seasons, it can get uncomfortably humid.

Winter is also a very popular time but it does tend to get expensive so you might have to plan early!

## Where to stay

Tampa has a lot of hotels in the prime downtown area that you can reserve. I chose to book an airbnb in the more quieter Beach Park area. South Tampa and North Hyde Park areas are also very affordable and safe places to stay. If you are a solo traveler and want a safer area, avoid the Ybor District after sundown.

You can use this Airbnb code to get $55.00 off your first airbnb reservation! <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/c/asavadatti1?currency=USD">Airbnb Code</a>

## What to take with you

Basic sun protective gear like sunscreen, sunglasses and a hat are essential all year round. You might want to carry a light cardigan for after sunset as some days might get ever so slightly chilly. I also recommend downloading offline google maps.

# Where to Eat

Tampa has so many amazing restaurants and bars to choose from. My top piks are:

## Ulele
Sitting right next to the Hillsborough River, Ulele is the perfect place for either a quick snack or even a cold beer after a warm day. The ambience here is wonderful and its equally appealing to adults and kids. The Waterworks park is right next door if you want to join the Riverwalk.

## Armature Works
Just about 10 minutes from Ulele is the Armature works - A historic restored structure now a thriving food court. From Italian to Indian, smoothies to cupcakes, you will find everything you need to satiate you taste buds all under one roof.

If you don't have an appetite for more food, I would recommend at least getting a delicious cone of Astro Ice cream and enjoying it by the river!

## Oxford Exchange
Do you want an elegant and delicious brunch? Do you want a high end bookstore? Are you a tea person? Well there is something for everyone at the Oxford Exchange. Even though it is very difficult to find a spot to park around here, I highly recommend checking it out!

## La Segunda Center Bakery
Your trip will not be complete without getting the historic cuban sandwich and there is no place better than the La Segunda Bakery. It is one of the oldest and largest bakeries in Tampa and a must for some amazing breakfast sandwiches.

## Colombia restaurants

The oldest restaurant in all of Tampa, The Colombia is great for all meals of the day. Be sure to make reservations a few days ahead as they fill out quick! I was unable to get a reservation even though I was traveling solo but I know what I'll do in Tampa the next time I visit!


# Popular Tourist Attractions

## Tampa Bay River Walk

![image1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/tampa/t6.jpg){:height="400px" width="840px"}

Stretching from the north to the south end of Tampa along 8 miles of the Hillsborough River, the Tampa Riverwalk is one of the most popular things to do while in the city. You can rent a bike and go from one end to the other or just walk along admiring the tall buildings on one side and the beautiful Tampa University on the other. Another mode of commute is through the water - there are taxi's available that take you to various points.

There are tons of events happening at the Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park that are always fun to be a part of. While I was there, I got to see the annual "Bark in the Park" event with so many adorable dogs!

Right next to the park is the Tampa Museum of Art and the Glazer's Children's Museum which are both great locations to spend the afternoon and beat the heat!

## Sparkman Wharf

On the southmost part of the river walk, about a mile from the Curtis Hixon Park is one one the funnest places in Tampa. The Sparkman Wharf has food, live music and tons of beer! You can wave out to the large cruise ships leaving for their trips or even hang out at the park and read a book. It is colorful, has so much energy and great for all ages. There is tons of parking available if you decide to get your car here.

## The Dali Museum

If you are an admirer of surrealistic and modern art, you have to visit the Dali Museum. It has the largest collection of Dali's artwork outside of Europe and each one is more enthralling than the other. They also have a Virtual Reality room so you can really immerse yourself into Dali's world.

The price for admission is $17.00 online and there is a ton of parking near and around the place. Be sure to carry change for the meters!!

## Beaches at St. Pete's!
![image1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/tampa/t14.jpg){:height="400px" width="840px"}

Depending on how long you have, I would suggest spending a full day at the various beaches. I started off at Clearwater and stopped at John's Pass Village making my way to St.Pete's beach for the most glorious sunset!

![image1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/tampa/f4.jpg){:height="400px" width="840px"}

There are a lot of beachside restaurants along the coast, especially in St. Pete's. Ones that I really enjoyed are Caddy's Treasure Island, Jimmy B's Beach Bar and Toasted Monkey. These "shacks" have day long live music, food and alcohol so it's a great sport to have the perfect beach party.

![image1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/tampa/t15.jpg){:height="400px" width="840px"}

As the beaches are very commercial, you will find many tourists laying on the white sandy beaches basking away in the sun looking forward to a magnificent sunset. Tampa is truly a wonderfully quaint city with so much to do especially as a solo traveller. It is safe, fun and lively!
