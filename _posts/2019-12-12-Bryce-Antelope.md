Bryce and Antelope Canyon have been on my list for quite some time now. I saw a images of the 'Horseshoe Bend' on Instagram and instantly fell in love. The short trip can get exhausting but a long weekend is plenty of time to visit the parks and really take the nature in. If you have more time on your hands, this trip can easily be coupled with Zion Nation Park as well. I have spoken in detail about Zion in another post that you can find here - [Zion National Park](https://theduckingtraveller.com/zion-park/)

The best way to start your trip is to fly into either Las Vegas or Phoenix - I personally recommend Las Vegas as there is just so much to do there if you have a spare day or two. The drive to Bryce Canyon is approximately 4 hours from Vegas. You cross over from Nevada to Arizona and then enter Utah.

You can rent a car from Las Vegas Airport and drive to either Springdale or Orderville, Utah on day1. We booked an Airbnb for 2 night at Orderville. Although it is 1 hour away from the Visitor Center, Orderville has a cute downtown area with really good Mexican food places.

# Horseshoe Bend

From Orderville, we started to make our way to Page, AZ which is about an hour and half drive. The drive itself is very scenic and shorter in comparison to the previous days hectic schedule. Around an hour into the trip, we made a pitstop at Wahweep. It has the most gorgeous views of the Wahweep bay.

I really loved just sitting still and taking in the gorgeous mountains, the vast clear blue sky and the crystal clear water below.

One of the most important things to note to here and the biggest tip I can give is to keep track of the time. This is where two time zones collide and it can get quite confusing as to what the time really is.

Horseshoe bend is notably one of the most touristy location in Utah. I honestly thought it would be underwhelming but after the short hike to the bend, I was blown away. The bend is really breath-taking and truly worth the hype.

The bend is famous for its sunset and sunrise views. We stayed a while among the crowd. There were a LOT of people but everyone was very respectable and just enjoying the view.
