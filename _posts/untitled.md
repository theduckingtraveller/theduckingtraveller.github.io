If I had to define Texas in one word, it would be BIG! Everything in this lone star state is ginormous! The roads have more lanes, the cars are bigger even the quantity of food in restaurants is massive. I was in El Paso a few months ago and even in the small city things were so different from that in California.

My trip to Dallas was impromptu and short and since the tickets were really inexpensive, I decided to make my way to the Big D! There are two major airports in the Dallas metropolitan area, Dallas-Fort Worth (which is the fourth busiest airport in the country) and Dallas Airport. If you are visiting from a different state, the best and quickest way to reach the city would be flying into one of the two airports.

The airports are located about 45 minutes and since ride-sharing is really expensive here, the best way to get around the city is to rent a car at the airport.

## Touristy things to see in Dallas:

### The Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Gardens:

Located at the west entrance of the White Rock Lake Park is the Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Garden. It is one of the most beautiful botanical gardens I have been to in the country. With its vibrant flower garden and the scenic view of the lake, you could easily spend an entire day inside the park.

### White Rock Lake Park

I had to kill time one afternoon and I decided to check out White Rock Lake. It is surprisingly big and very quaint. Sitting on the pier munching on some sandwiches and watching kayakers row away was a really nice way to spend my time. I can’t deny it was a little too quiet but getting some peace within the hustle bustle of a city is always welcome.

### Trinity Overlook Park and Margaret McDermott Bridge

### Reunion Tower

Reunion Tower is one of those touristy things people do while in Dallas. It has an observation deck overlooking the Dallas skyline and a 360-degree restaurant by Wolfgang Puck. It is the 15th tallest building in Dallas.

### JFK Memorial Plaza

The memorial plaza is very tranquil and the people visiting are very respectful of the history. There is a museum right across the street where you get an in-depth lesson on the history of this place.

### Klyde Warren Park

Have you ever heard a park located over a freeway? No? Klyde Warren Park is! It is one of the unique places in Dallas where you can play games, have some food and enjoy fresh air while being in the middle of the city, over one of the busiest freeways in the city.

### Giant Eyeball

A giant 30 ft eyeball in the middle of the city is just what the city was missing. Situated within the Hotel Joule, the eyeball is an art piece created by Chicago based artist Tony Tasset. The eyeball is a very popular photography destination for many tourists.

### Mexican Food:

RJ Mexican Cuisine –> 

I love myself some good spicy Mexican food at all times of the day and night. If you are as much of a foodie as I am and love Mexican cuisine, you should stop for dinner at the RJ Mexican Cuisine. They serve delicious food in huge quantities and also provide a very calm and classy atmosphere with outdoor seating. It is located at the North Market Street in downtown Dallas.

### Uptown Bars:

Uptown has the best bars and clubs in Dallas. You can park your car at your hotel and hop bars exploring new themes and the culture of Dallas. The bars are vibrant, happening and have a really great crowd turn up even on weekdays. A few I really liked are:

### Sambuca

If you like live music, good food, and great beer, Sambuca is the place to go. There is one in Uptown and another in Legacy drive in Plano. Both of them have great bands playing live country music and they take requests as well.

### Concrete Cowboy

If you like listening and dancing to pop music, Concrete Cowboys is the place you should be at. It has a huge dance floor and a wide variety of drinks available. I really liked the atmosphere that they have here and the people seem like they are having a really good time.

### The Rustic

The Rustic is famous for its wide range of beers, live music, and outdoor seating. You can go here on any day and the crowd is just as high on energy as the weekend. I really liked the service here and the beer is served is huge goblet like glasses. They have a really good food selection including burgers and sandwiches. I would recommend spending an entire evening here just catching up with old friends or making new ones all while listening to extraordinary music!

Dallas was huge, with a lot of really wonderful people and the most delicious food. It was a quick getaway for me and even though I didn’t go with high expectations, I had the best time and I felt like there was so much more to do and explore. I hope this helps you plan your weekend trip to the city down south!
