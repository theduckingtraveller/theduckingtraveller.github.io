We rented our snorkel gear from [Snorkel Bob's](https://snorkelbob.com/). The best thing about this was we were able to drop if off at a different location. The rental process was easy and we got snorkel gear and fins.

## Day 2 - Lydgate Snorkel, Island from above, Princeville



Making a reservation with a trusted guide company helps a ton. We booked with [Maui Magic](https://www.snorkelmolokini.com/maui-magic) as they offered vegetarian breakfast and lunch. We really enjoyed our experience with them and would recommend them to others.

## Sunsets



Hawaii is the kind of place you want to keep coming back to. The people, the beaches, the sunset, the food - it all takes your breath away. I was here for a short while but I cannot wait to be back on my next Hawaiian adventure!
