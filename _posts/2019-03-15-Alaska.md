I have travelled around the United States a fair bit but the sheer beauty that Alaska has to offer is unparalleled. The entire state is serene and not only quite unparalleled in its raw authentic natural beauty but also famous for its rich heritage. It was a real pleasure visiting the state and only having covered very little of it, it has left me longing to go back for more.

Being in the heart of the state with no internet connection, minimal service and nature all around really helped with my anxiety. You tend to forget all the problems that you have back home and feel very at peace with yourself. I would recommend Alaska for everyone but more so for people looking for a more rejuvenating experience.

The route that we took was a little tricky as we drove south to Seward first and then drove all the way to Denali National Park and then back to Anchorage. You should choose the route that makes most sense to you but either way, you need to be prepared to drive - A lot!

I'll talk about the different places we went to and the things that are a must do there.

#### Getting Around:

We took a flight from Seattle to Alaska. The average ticket prices are around $200.00 but depending on the season this can vary.

You will need a car to get around to different locations. We reserved an Enterprise rental car for the entire duration of our stay here. We picked the car from the airport and specifically choose a 4 wheel drive for ease and comfort.

##### Best Time to Travel:

Alaska is beautiful and open to tourists all year round but the best time to visit depends on what your agenda is. If you are looking forward to experiencing the Northern Lights, your best bet is to travel during the more dry cold months of November -February. If you want to hike being comparatively warm, tourist season is between June - September.

#### This to have with you:

> Apart from the obvious items such a a bottle of water and sunscreen, I recommend carrying or purchasing bug spray.
> Layers! It can get quite cold even during summer.
> Binoculars - Great for bird watching and spotting bears.
> Picnic Blanket - Very useful!
> Groceries (Milk, Bread, Fruits, Ready to Cook) - This was a life saver when we were hours from any civilization during lunch time!

#### Anchorage:

Our arrival and departure airport was in Anchorage and it will probably be the same for you. Since our flight got in late, we stayed at the Best Western - Golden Lion hotel. The price for the hotel was around $150.00 per night. We spent our first and last night in Anchorage and didn't explore the city itself but there are many children friendly activities in Anchorage. Here are a few things that you might want to check out

1. Anchorage Museum
2. Alaska Aviation Museum
3. Botanical Gardens
4. Alaska Zoo


#### Seward:

The first leg of our journey consisted of driving from Anchorage to Seward which is south of Anchorage. It takes about 2.5 hours to drive down to Seward. This drive is really scenic and there are multiple places where you can take short pit-stops to admire the majesty of the mountains. I always recommend starting the day early so you have a lot of time to spend at the various locations.

We spent 2 nights in Seward. The first day was driving to the coastal city and hiking to the Exit Glacier and the second one was spent on the cruise.

Seward is a famous destination for day cruises, hikes, kayaking, and, fishing. We opted for the Major Marine Tours to take the surreal cruising experience. The guided cruise was scheduled for 8 hours and had catered lunch and snacks on board. The goal was to make it to Kenai Fjords National Park and back. The price per person for the cruise is about $214.00. This might seem a little steep but it is well worth the money. The crew is very informative and are great at spotting wildlife, and talking about the Fjords and the history behind the glaciers.

We were lucky enough to see various aquatic mammals such as Otters, Orkas, and Dolphins and many local birds such as the Bald Eagle, Black-Billed Magie, Puffins and the Steller's Jay.

The glaciers at Kenai Fjord are huge. This was my first time seeing a glacier next to the ocean. There were giant icebergs in the water that the captain had to cruise around. You can imagine how the titanic must have gone down because even small icebergs are resilient and strong.

#### Exit Glacier and Harding Ice Field Trail:

![image1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/alaska/4.jpeg){:height="400px" width="840px"}


Located about 30 minutes or 12 miles from Seward, the Exit Glacier and the Harding Ice Field Trail are one of the most popular treks for tourists.

#### Whittier

#### Denali

It takes about 7 hours to drive from Seward to Denali. We started early and took many many pit stops along the way. The view is gorgeous so it doesn't seem like a lot of driving but it is a 360 mile drive. Make sure to fill up on gas in Seward because there are very long patches where you don't get cell coverage and there are no gas stations.

One thing that I'm glad we did was to halt in Anchorage on our way and load up on supplies and stop for lunch.

#### Talkeetna:

Located about 153 miles south of Denali, it takes about 3 hours to drive down here.

#### Glacier Landing

It is said that at any time, there is only a 30% chance of seeing the peak of Mt Denali. You need to very very lucky to get a clear enough day in order to view the highest mountain in North America. We decided to make our own luck. One way to do this is to fly over the cloud cover and view the peak.

![image1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/alaska/20.jpeg){:height="400px" width="840px"}

Talkeetna has many air-taxi operators you can choose from to fly around Mt. Denali and land on one of the glaciers, spend some time there and fly back. This option is understandably very expensive but if you have the funds to do this, I highly recommend it. This was the highlight of our trip to Alaska. The price for 1 person to hop on the flight for a 2 hour experience is around $435.00. There are other options also available such as a flyby over the mountains which are far less expensive  at around $220.00 per person.

The people at Talkeetna Air Taxi were very responsive while I was making the reservations. They provide a lot of feedback and answer any questions that you have.

The tour includes crossing the Alaska Range, The Wickersham Wall of Denali - the greatest continual vertical relief in the world, and landing on a Glacier. We had unobstructed, heavenly view of the snow covered peak of Mt Denali.

#### Hurricane Turn Train:

![image1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/alaska/31.jpeg){:height="400px" width="840px"}

Alaskan Railroads are rightfully quite popular amongst the railbuffs. The flag-stop trains are a really fun experience as you get to see people living in remote regions with no road access. The only way to get to and from their cabins is by literally flagging the trains down. Alaska has a lot of raw nature and riding along the mountains and trees in a all window train can never disappoint, can it?  

![image1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/alaska/23.jpeg){:height="400px" width="840px"}

If you have an extra day and don't want to do any strenous hikes or driving, the best way to spend that day would be to hop on the Hurricane Turn Train. Starting at Talkeetna, the train takes to the city of Hurricane and back.

![image1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/alaska/25.jpeg){:height="400px" width="840px"}


The trains make multiple stops so you can go out and explore ruins of cities that once were, the smallest town in the world with the population of 2 and ofcourse the gorgeous Twin Bridges. On a clear day, you might get to see Mt. Denali from the trains.

![image1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/alaska/29.jpeg){:height="400px" width="840px"}


It costs $108.00 for a round trip from Talkeetna to Hurricane. The rail service encourages passengers to get their own food on board and enjoy a unique picnic experience.

#### Restaurants:

Le Barn Appetit: Located very close to the Exit Glacier, this family owned restaurant is great for an early brunch. The crepes are delicious, the service is sincere and the place itself is very homey.

Namaste Shangril-la: Sometimes you have got to curb those spicy Indian food cravings and that is exactly what we did! Anchorage has a lot of amazing sea-food but being vegetarians, we opted for a more traditional option of getting some filling spicey food. Namaste Shangril-la has some good options for food that wont fill you but will keep you satisfied for many hours of driving that you have ahead of you.

Payo’s Thai: Talkeetna being the quirky little town that it is has surprisingly good food. Payo's had a light, fun atmosphere and the people were really having a great time.


Alaska has so much to offer and so much that I would love to go back for. This was an experience unlike any other that you will have and no matter where you decide to go, what you decide to do, you will be in a magical wonderland of a state and the experiences will be truly out of the world. If you are thinking of going to Alaska, don't think just go!
