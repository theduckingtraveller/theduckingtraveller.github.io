I am always enthralled by how underrated the Northern Indian states are. The raw energy that the locals ooze out to the ever delicious food and refreshing cups of tea, there is not one thing but everything that makes Assam and Mizoram an ideal destination.

I find that these states have not yet taken over as popular tourist destinations making them ideal for a relaxing, fun filled adventure vacation spot!

## When to go

The best time to visit these Assam and Mizoram is between the months of November and March. Although located in the north, they are very pleasant during winter and spring. The temperature ranges between 50F to 70F which according to me is the best weather to travel in.

Monsoons in these states can get unforgiving and it's best to avoid that time to travel.

## How to get around

The capital of Assam, Guwahati is a thriving city and has an airport that connects you to all major cities in India. The city also has an international airport connecting you to Singapore and Nepal.

Travel around Assam and Mizoram can get a little tricky. You will be stuck in a car for a few hours a day at least. We rented a chauffeur driven car from <a href="https://www.savaari.com/"> Savaari</a>

The rates are very affordable and make things that much more convenient for you.

## Where to Stay and Eat

# IORA, Kaziranga National Park

We stayed in IORA Resort in Kaziranga National Park. The hotel was very big with all the amenities including a spa and dance performances by the locals. If you wanted, the staff would build you a fire on a cold night. I also have to mention that the resort has very less light pollution leading to gorgeous night skies.

Along with it being a really wonderful place to stay, they had a wonderful restaurant with local food available to eat! The food at the IORA restaurant was really good and again, thali style.

# Orange Roots, Cherrapunjee

Another vegetarian only place on my list! I liked Orange Roots because they have a "thali system" which means that you get a small portion of different dishes on a platter. This way you get a little of everything and its delicious and filling!

You will find this spot on your way back from Cherrapunjee. The Living Root Bridge hike prepares you for a heavy meal that the Orange Root delivers on!
