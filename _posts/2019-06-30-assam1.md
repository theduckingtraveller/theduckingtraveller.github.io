If you haven't figured it out yet, I love being in nature. I enjoy the silence and the wonder that it has to offer. Nature is super lit and there is proof of that in both Kaziranga and Cherrapunji.

Kaziranga National Park and Cherrapunji Forest are both a 4 hour drive from Guwahati, Assam. One thing to note is that both are in different directions so you may have to pair Cherrapunji with Shillong to cover two spots in one go.

I'm going to skip the how to get around part for this entry as I've already spoken about it in a previous post. Click <a href="https://theduckingtraveller.com/assam/">here</a> to read about what to do in Guwahati and Shillong.

# Best time to visit

The Kaziranga National Park stays closed for visitors from May 1st till October 31st every year. Monsoons are rough in the part of the country and so the best time to visit is the winter months.

# Where to Stay and Eat

## IORA, Kaziranga National Park

We stayed in IORA Resort in Kaziranga National Park. The hotel was very big with all the amenities including a spa and dance performances by the locals. If you wanted, the staff would build you a fire on a cold night. I also have to mention that the resort has very less light pollution leading to gorgeous night skies.

Along with it being a really wonderful place to stay, they had a wonderful restaurant with local food available to eat! The food at the IORA restaurant was really good and again, thali style.

## Shelter Inn, Shillong

The Shelter Inn was a nice hotel to crash at for a night or two while in the city of Shillong. It didn't have a lot of services but it had a really wonderful view. We booked this hotel which also provided complimentary breakfast in Shillong using OYO Rooms.

This Indian hospitality company provides affordable hotels all over the country (and world). Think of it as the Indian airbnb. Visit their website for more information. <a href"https://www.oyorooms.com/">OYO</a>

## Orange Roots, Cherrapunjee

Another vegetarian only place on my list! I liked Orange Roots because they have a "thali system" which means that you get a small portion of different dishes on a platter. This way you get a little of everything and its delicious and filling!

You will find this spot on your way back from Cherrapunjee. The Living Root Bridge hike prepares you for a heavy meal that the Orange Root delivers on!

# Kaziranga National Park

Kaziranga National Park is located in the east of Assam. If you want to immerse yourself into a jurassic era, this park transports you there. Along with being home to the iconic one-horned Rhinoceros, you can also find elephants, wild water buffalo, and swamp deers. If you are lucky, you could even spot a tiger.

The park has 4 main entry points:
> Mihimukh in Central Range at Kohora

> Bagori in Western Range at Bagori

> Agaratoli in Eastern Range at Agaratoli

> Ghorakati in Burapahar Range at Ghorakhati

Depending on which hotel you are staying at, you will need to make reservations for the Jeep and Elephant Safari. I'd advice booking the tickets in advance to avoid missing out if the safari's are overbooked.
