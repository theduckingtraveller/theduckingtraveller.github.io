I am always enthralled by how under-rated the Northern Indian states are. The raw energy that the locals ooze out to the ever delicious food and refreshing cups of tea, there is not one thing but everything that makes Assam and Mizoram an ideal destination.

I find that these states have not yet taken over as popular tourist destinations making them ideal for a relaxing, fun filled adventure vacation spot!

# When to go

The best time to visit Assam and Mizoram is between the months of November and March. Although located in the north, they are very pleasant during winter and spring. The temperature ranges between 50F to 70F which according to me is the best weather to travel in.

Monsoons in these states can get unforgiving and it's best to avoid that time to travel.

# How to get around

The capital of Assam, Guwahati is a thriving city and has an airport that connects you to all major cities in India. The city also has an international airport connecting you to Singapore and Nepal.

Travel around Assam and Mizoram can get a little tricky. You will be stuck in a car for a few hours a day at least. We rented a chauffeur driven car from <a href="https://www.savaari.com/"> Savaari</a>

The rates are very affordable and make things that much more convenient for you.

# Where to Stay and Eat

## Jiva, Nongpoh

It's easy to miss this vegetarian joint on your way to Shillong from Guwahati. I added this to my list because they do have good food, its a nice spot to stretch your legs, get some grub and head on further to Shillong.

## La Galerie, Shillong

Located in the heart of Shillong's bazar, the La Galerie is on my list solely because it gives you an amazing view of all the hustle of the market surrounding it. There are literally hundreds of locals shopping till almost 10 pm in the night and it gets very chaotic.

## Radisson Blu, Guwahati

Priced at about $100.00 a night, this hotel was really a five star experience. It is at a very convenient location with a gym, spa and a swimming pool. They have buffet breakfast, lunch and dinner and the food takes your pallet all around India.

## Taj Vivanta, Guwahati

Vivanta by Taj is another really affordable yet fancy hotel to stay at in Guwahati. Priced similar to the Radisson at $100.00 per night, this high end hotel provides all the necessary luxurious. They grow their own vegetables and the food here is fresh + local = mouth watering!
